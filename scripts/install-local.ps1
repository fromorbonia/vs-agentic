.SYNOPSIS
    Builds VsAgentic and installs it into your real Visual Studio instance for
    day-to-day use, replacing any previously installed copy.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the dogfooding path: use your own build as your daily driver
    without publishing to the Marketplace.

    All Visual Studio instances must be closed — VSIXInstaller cannot replace
    an extension whose files are loaded, and the script refuses to run rather
    than leave you with a half-installed extension.

    Because the local build and the published extension share an Identity Id,
    Visual Studio treats them as the same extension. If the Marketplace
    version ever exceeds yours, VS's automatic extension update will silently
    replace your local build. Use -BumpPatch to stay ahead, and consider
    disabling automatic extension updates in
    Tools > Options > Environment > Extensions.

    Reinstalling the same version works because the script uninstalls first.
    VSIXInstaller rejects a package whose Identity Id and Version both match an
    already-installed extension, so an unbumped rebuild installed on its own
    would silently do nothing. The script verifies the uninstall and the install
    against the extension directory on disk rather than trusting exit codes.

.PARAMETER BumpPatch
    Increment the patch component of the version in source.extension.vsixmanifest
    before building. Keeps your local build ahead of the published version so VS
    never overwrites it and the update InfoBar stays quiet. Not required to pick
    up a rebuild - see above.

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
    Install the VSIX already present in bin\Release without rebuilding.

.PARAMETER Configuration
    Build configuration. Defaults to Release.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\install-local.ps1
    Build and install the current version.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\install-local.ps1 -BumpPatch
    Bump 3.5.0 to 3.5.1, build, and install.
